Introducing Rallly Pro, the premium subscription plan that will complete your scheduling workflow.

The flagship feature included with Rallly Pro is the ability to select a date and finalize your polls.

When you finalize a poll you and your participants will receive an email with the final date and a calendar invite.

Rallly Pro users will also be able to keep their polls indefinitely. i.e. They won't be automatically deleted due to inactivity or dates being in the past.

The initial price for Rallly Pro will be $5 per month or $30 per year. That's just $2.50 per month!

With your support, I can sustain my work on Rallly, implementing numerous highly-requested features. As a subscriber, you are playing a key role to make this happen, and also have the opportunity to influence Rallly's future direction.

Thank you and as always if you have any [feedback](mailto:feedback@rallly.co), I'd be happy to hear from you!
