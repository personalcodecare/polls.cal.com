## About the Live Chat

The live chat gives you a direct line to me, the developer. It's a great way to troubleshoot any
issues or bugs that you may be experiencing. While I try my best to answer inquiries as quickly as
possible, I may not always be in a position to respond immediately.

If it's not urgent, please consider sending an email instead.
