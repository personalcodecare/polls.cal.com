<Info>Available in v3.4.0 and later.</Info>

<Warning>
#### Account Linking

Accounts using the same email are linked together. This assumes
that you are using a trusted identity provider that uses verified email
addresses.

</Warning>

## OpenID Connect (OIDC)

If your identity provider supports OAuth 2.0 based authentication with OpenID Connect (OIDC), you can use it to authenticate users on your Rallly instance.

### Required Scopes

Your OAuth 2.0 application needs to be configured with the following scopes:

- `openid`: Essential for OIDC to function, used to perform authentication.
- `profile`: Access to the user's personal information such as name and picture.
- `email`: Access to the user's email address.

### Callback URL / Redirect URI

Your identity provider will redirect the user back to the following URL:

```
{BASE_URL}/api/auth/callback/oidc
```

<Info>
  Replace `{BASE_URL}` with the base URL of your Rallly instance and add it to
  the list of allowed redirect URIs.
</Info>

### Configuration

The following configuration options are available for OIDC.
All required fields must be set for OIDC to be enabled.
