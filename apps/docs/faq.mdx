<Accordion title="Is Rallly free?">
  Most of Rallly's features are free and many users will never need to pay for
  anything. However, there are some features that are only available to paying
  customers. These features are designed to help you get the most out of Rallly
  and also help pay for the cost of running and maintaining the service.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need to create an account to use Rallly?">
  No, you don't! You can create and share polls without creating an account.
  However, some features (like email notifications) are only available to users
  with an account.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are there any limits to the number of polls, participants and options I can make?">
  No, there are no limits to the number of polls, participants or options you
  make. There are technical limits in place to prevent misuse but these are very
  generous and should not affect normal usage.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long will Rallly keep my meeting poll?">
  Meeting polls are automatically deleted when all date options are in the past
  AND the meeting poll has not been accessed for over 30 days. This doesn't
  apply if you have an paid subscription that is active.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I limit the number of participants that can vote for an option?">
  No, this feature is currently not supported but may be added in the future.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I set a deadline for my poll?">
  No, this feature is currently not supported but may be added in the future.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I'm not receiving emails from Rallly?">
  First, check your spam folder.

Not there?

If the email is not in your spam folder and you're not receiving _any_ emails from us, it's possible that you've been added to our suppression list.
This can happen if you or your email provider mark an email from Rallly as spam.
If you think this has happened, please [contact us](/contact) and we'll remove you from the list.
